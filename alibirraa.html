      Let us strengthen the 3<sup>rd</sup>-year commemoration of Artist Ali Birra in order to continue his legacy!
    </div>

    <p>
      Artist Dr. Ali Birra, who passed away on 6 November 2022, is remembered every year through various special programmes.
      Therefore, in 2025, to mark the 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of his passing, we have planned to carry out five concrete activities in his memory:
    </p>

    <h2>Five Memorial Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Education &amp; Clothing Drive</strong> – Provide clothing and school supplies to 17 orphans who have lost a parent while living in displacement, so they may regain hope and continue their education.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Unity through Sports</strong> – Organise friendly sporting events among different teams to promote unity.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Dr. Ali Birra Day</strong> – Bring together 10 children who suffer from congenital disabilities or minor illnesses in one playground so they can feel encouraged.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Elders’ Health Support</strong> – Support elderly people over the age of 60 who live in displacement and are afflicted by various illnesses, helping them to recover their strength.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Grand Finale Ceremony</strong> – Conclude the commemoration with a large public gathering of all Oromo people in the Galma (hall), featuring special programmes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Call to Action</h2>
    <p>
      The above points are meant to fulfil the vision of Dr. Ali Birra. Since he spent his life working for his people,
      Ali remains an example for the next generation; passing that example on is therefore our duty.
      I, for my part, have decided to implement this project in Cairo, Egypt, where a large Oromo community lives.
    </p>

    <h2>Notice</h2>
    <p>
      Permission to hold this 3<sup>rd</sup>-anniversary commemoration of Hon. Artist Dr. Ali Birra must be obtained from his widow,
      Mrs. Ilillii Birra, and from the Ali Birra Foundation.
    </p>

    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      For this idea to succeed in a spirit of Oromo identity and patriotism, and for the value of our people’s labour to bear fruit,
      we ask every one of you not to stand aside. All the items listed above require funding, so whatever you can afford—
      please <a href="#sponsor">sponsor us</a> with respect and great honour.
